Hi my name is Nathan and i am a web developer. I have around 2 years of experience(mostly coming from school) working with websites and i am confident in my abilities.
Up to now i have worked with the essentials: html and css, and some other languages: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and a bit of C#. I also have experience with the CMS builders WordPress
and CodeIgniter. Right now I am trying to learn more about GitHub and start working with it more than I did during my time in school.

You can reach my by contacting my email: nathanhamelin0531@gmail.com
